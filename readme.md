    Grab details from all videos from a Youtube channel

## About The Project

Grab details of a Youtube channel, and all its videos, WITHOUT ANY API!
The extension just scrolls down with a timeout, and parses the details directly from the webpage.
Data from the page will be saved to the clipboard as an object.

### Note

Some data, like date uploaded might not be totally accurate. This is because it's not possible to capture them from the channel page.

## Contributions

There's a lot of work to be done, like:

- [ ] Extracting more data from the page
- [ ] Better ux/flow
- [ ] Error handling

Feel free to raise a Pull request.
