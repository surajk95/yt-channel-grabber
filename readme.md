    Grab details from all videos from a Youtube channel

## About The Project

Grab details of a Youtube channel, and all its videos, WITHOUT ANY API!
The extension just scrolls down with a timeout, and parses the details directly from the webpage.
Data from the page will be saved to the clipboard as an object.

## Contributions

There's a lot of work to be done, like:

- [ ] Structuring the length of videos-it's word format currently like 53 minutes 23 seconds
- [ ] Date uploaded: comes as ["4", "days"]. Need to convert to standard date based on the current date.
- [ ] Error handling (the try-catch in content.js doesn't work)

Feel free to raise a Pull request for that.
